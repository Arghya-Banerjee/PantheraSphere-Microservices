## üõ†Ô∏è Current Standards Followed

- **Primary Key**: UUID (uniqueidentifier in SQL Server)
- **Architecture**: Microservices (No cross-entity JPA relations)
- **Tech Stack**: Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate 6+, MS SQL Server
- **DTO usage** for Create/Update clean request handling
- **Microservice-safe** foreign key handling (UUID IDs only)

---

## üöÄ Future Work

### Forest Service
- Add forest analytics APIs (area-based stats, state-wise distribution)
- Audit forest modifications (createdAt, modifiedAt fields)

### Tiger Service
- Add image uploads for each tiger
- Implement soft delete (add `isDeleted` flag)
- Integrate with Observation service (future)
- Add tiger movement tracking (sightings history)

### Other Services To Build
- `user-service` (for authentication, role management)
- `safari-service` (to log safari trips)
- `observation-service` (to record tiger sightings)
- `report-service` (for analytics and conservation reports)
